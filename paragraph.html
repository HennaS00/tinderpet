        <p>Hello frens! These are two webpages that we have created to help us abandoned animals find a purrrfect home! It is based on a Tinder-like approach, and allows you hoomans to choose which one of us furry friends you are looking for. We think this will encourage you to adopt, instead of â€˜shoppingâ€™ for us pets at re-tail stores. It would really make us so happy and such a difference to our homeless animal community, as it can be quite ruff sometimes.</p>

        <p>We have used some user interaction, as you can see the links change colour as you place your paws over them. Although we are colour-blind, we think this would make your experience on the webpage so much more fun and interactive, so that you are more willing to allow us to join your family! Furthermore, on the homepage, we used a carousel function from bootstrap to make the profile pictures cycle between each other in order to mimic the swiping left action on tinder. From the homepage, if you tap on â€˜Find your matchâ€™, it will take you to a log in page where you can create an account. For a special treat, try click on the â€˜letâ€™s match upâ€™ button and see what happens. If you change your mind, you can click on â€˜back to homepageâ€™ to take you back.</p>

        <p>So we have lined up and created some profiles, used some pup-arazzi to take some photoshoots for us, so you know just how we look like. It would be fun-tastic to be part of your litter ðŸ˜Š. We hope you enjoy our website because I would be so fur-tunate to have you in my life! </p>
